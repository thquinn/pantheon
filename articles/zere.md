To **Zere, Goddess of Poison**, we humans are less than insects. Insects have deliberate, elegant forms designed for survival, where humans are jacks of all trades with soft, proportionally weak bodies that seem designed by committee. (And as theologians have it, they actually were.) Zere is one of very few gods known to kill humans unprovoked and without warning, for the sake of experimentation and simple amusement. That humans have come to accept this only disgusts her further.

It may seem illogical, then, that any humans are born under her auspices at all. The Aezere are relatively few, to be sure, but not to the point of rarity. They are a strange and self-loathing bunch, often seeking to enhance themselves physically and mentally, or even to remake themselves in another image entirely. They reject the pity that is heaped upon them by children of more sympathetic gods. Those that find a place in society are stereotypically guides, botanists, apothecaries, and warriors.

The Aezere warrior is an intimidating foe that most hope to never find themselves up against. Not only is she likely to be a paragon of fitness and cunning, but she has natural resistances to several ploys that one might use to try to even the odds: the physical, like pressure points; the chemical, like toxins and narcotics; and the psychological, like fear. Despite these unnatural advantages, they are not universally disliked â€” and no one hates Aezeres as much as they hate themselves.

# Pawns

Rather than create her own, Zere elects members of mundate species to become her pawns, collectively called **Aezere fauna**. Snakes, spiders, scorpions, frogs and toads, wasps, and jellyfish: every known poisonous or venomous animal has at some point been observed under her boon. Aezere fauna are smarter and slightly larger than their non-divine ilk, take on a lustrous appearance with a prominent mark of Zere, and are significantly more poisonous. The purpose they serve is a point of theological debate; as a popular theory goes, they act as her spies and assassins, or maybe it's a blessing meant to help her chosen creatures protect themselves. It's certainly worked for the platypus colony of Lake Delaide, which an Aezere alpha has ferociously guarded for nearly a century.
