One of very few gods known to kill humans without warning. Views them as lesser beings useful for experimentation.

# Pawns

Rather than create her own, Zere elects members of mundate species to become her pawns, collectively called **Aezere animals**. Snakes, spiders, scorpions, frogs and toads, wasps and bees: every conceivable poisonous or venomous animal has at some point been observed under her boon. Aezere animals are smarter and slightly larger than their non-divine ilk, take on a lustrous appearance with a prominent mark of Zere, and are significantly more poisonous. The purpose they serve is a point of theological debate; as a popular theory goes, they act as her spies and assassins, or maybe it's a blessing meant to help her chosen creatures protect themselves. It's certainly worked for the platypus colony of Lake Delaide, which an Aezere alpha has ferociously guarded for nearly a century.
