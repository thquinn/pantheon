}

One can hardly imagine a pair of gods with more opposed quiddities, and indeed, the laid-back Vicunius and the uptight Vandine are known as an archetypal divine odd couple. Vandine loathes Vicinius's apathy (which is, of course, his prime quiddity), as, in the eternal battle that good wages against evil, he views bystanders in no higher esteem than he does the ne-er-do-wells themselves. And Vicunius... well, he doesn't *hate* anything, but when his feelings towards another god reaches even the level of distaste, you know it's pretty serious.

Vandinians and Vicunes have less beef with each other than their birth gods do, and usually opt to just ignore each other. When they do find themselves at odds, it often falls to other gods' children to step in and re-establish the truce.

# Historical Events

* When conflicts between various gods began to impact the town of Merek, Vandine temporarily designated it a divine non-interference zone, but Vicunius continued to drop in on its Vicune inhabitants, with perhaps greater frequency than he had prior. Vandine accused the Visitor God of acting under ulterior motives, and of threatening the peace with his flagrant violation of the accord. In an event without precedent, the people of Merek sided with Vandine against Vicunius, and a poor Vicune turned him away for fear of becoming a pariah. No Vicune has been born there since.
