The arc of **Azimech, God of Propagation** as he pertains to humanity is an unfortunate one. When the species was newer and the gods were fewer, our grip on this world was not yet absolute. We were simply the experiment of a cabal of gods, a smattering of settlements in a small territory. When our creators had grown tired of us, as the story goes, it was Azimech who took on our cause, who pushed us out into the world and showed us how to thrive. It was a time when all the gods' children extolled the virtues of the God of Moths.

But fickle is the favor of man. As the ages passed, we became secure in our primacy, and the auspices of our divine parent became, we thought, a hindrance. The name of Azimech began to take on new meanings, ones of increasing concern to mankind's burgeoning population: plague, infestation, and rumormongering. The choice was not his; as a god must, he took on this new mantle, and the lies became truth.

Today, when the swaddling of a newborn babe turns to silk overnight, it is an occasion to be mourned. While those born under Azimech aren't exactly pariahs, they are thought to be somewhat separate from other people. They tend to be leaders, though of whom is the subject of negative stereotype. Some are quite reclusive, perhaps taking a spouse and starting families far out into the world. Some Azemics even go against type, becoming doctors and farmers and using their knowledge of pestilence to keep it at bay. Perhaps they seek to restore Azimech's good name, and remind us of who he once was.

# Pawns

**Fraejens**, colloquially known as the *lanternmen*, are Azimech's pseudocorporeal pawns. As you might expect from the name, they are always seen carrying lanterns that cast soft yellow light at night and emit a field of shadow during the day. Rarely are they found in heavily populated areas, instead sticking to marshes, forests, and the hinterlands. This is just as well, far as most people are concerned, as they seem almost purpose-built to inspire superstition.

Around a typical fraejen will be an eclipse of **guidemoths**. They are attracted to their host's lantern at night and lurk in its shadow by day, but other than that not much is known about them. Some say the lanternmen wander by their will, and should a man become enveloped by them, that he might follow them to his doom. Theologians have tested this theory and, to the chagrin of some members of the public, none have suffered such a fate.
