# Welcome to Pantheon.

The world of Beledh is governed by gods. Hundreds of gods. A god for everything, for every concept natural and artificial, every aspect of existence human or otherwise, and every child of Beledh is born under the auspices of one of those gods. No one knows why, or how the choice is made, but from the moment their characteristic omen manifests, one's birth god is an inescapable part of one's identity. Most — but not all — ultimately decide to follow the path laid out for them, and seek to embody the qualities held most highly by their divine benefactor.

# The Rules (in brief)

In **Pantheon**, every action you take will fall under the purview of one or more gods. Being at their whim, your chance of success will be determined in part by your affinity with that god. It will also be determined by that god's ever-shifting status within the pantheon, and by that god's relationships and histories with any other gods applicable to the situation. As you play, your affinities will change according to your actions and how they affect the machinations of each god. You may also change how the gods view each other, by settling old scores, opening new rifts, or by simple cooperation with others. You'll get more detail about this as we go.

# The Scenario

On the island village of [[Nuray]], the tradition of *pursuance* dictates that when children become adults, they must go out and make their mark upon the world. To facilitate this, they are placed into *cliques* of their peers — no two of which may share a birth god — and temporarily exiled from their homes. At the beginning of our campaign, the members of the party constitute one such clique, newly formed and about to begin their journey, like it or not.

Nuray being an isolated place, many of the gods are unknown to its people. (And its people unknown to many of the gods!) A random set of eight gods has been chosen as your starting pantheon. As you play, you will learn of more, forging connections with some and making enemies of others. Here's what we've got:

* [[Abcadef]], God of Language
* [[Azimech]], God of Propagation
* [[Emdre]], Goddess of Manipulation
* [[Helade]], Goddess of the Soul
* [[Tiveal]], Goddess of Flight
* [[Vandine]], God of Law
* [[Vicunius]], God of Apathy
* [[Zere]], Goddess of Poison

You will each choose ONE of these as your character's birth god, and then we'll get started. No overlapping! Settle disputes however you want.
