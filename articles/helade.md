The domain of **Helade, Goddess of the Soul** extends from horizon to conceptual horizon. Ignorant children of other gods assume that she is the goddess of the *human* soul, and while this is true, the Heladi know that we are not alone in possessing invisible, eternal spirits. Just as a rock is made of the same material substance as us, so too does it have a soul, composed of the same immaterial substance as ours. It may not give rise to thought or action, and it may ultimately be insignificant, but a small soul is a soul nevertheless. Heladi's great influence arises not only from her link to men and beasts, but from the power contained in the lives of the unliving, the so-called *animus of the inanimate*.

Tales abound of trouble unintentionally made by Helade: manikins springing to life and running off with their former owners, hills and rivers laying waste to settlements as they roam the land... and the dead rising from their graves to resume their business. Though statements made by Helade imply the existence of an afterlife, our understanding of it is woefully incomplete. Despite the best efforts of theologicans, some things, it seems, must still be experienced to be understood.

Despite the quiddity of their goddess, the Heladi aren't an overly cloud-headed people. While they respect the sanctity of the inanimate, it's not as though they're conscientious objectors to all activities that involve knocking two things together. They are carpenters, stonemasons, blacksmiths, and miners just like anyone else, though more stereotypically they are theologians and religious leaders. Those possessing a marked affinity with Helade have been said to speak to the unspeaking things of the world and exert their will, performing miracula like minor animations, soul manipulation, and invoking the essence of those things to their own ends.

**Itwhisks**, Helade's mischievous servants, are not well liked. They are lithe quadrupeds, about the size of chipmunks, with bizarrely flexible bodies. They use their elastic forelimbs to pry open the windows of unattended homes, scurry inside, and make off with the owners' possessions. The stolen items aren't necessarily valuable: they can be anything from family heirlooms to discarded wine corks. The items can also be extremely large and heavy, well beyond the capacity of a tiny creature to carry. How do they do it? Those who catch them in the act describe a swiping motion and a sudden disappearance, nothing more.

Inversely, random objects are sometimes found in the strangest of places: a toy of Trivian make in the farthest jungles of Yekrut, an illuminated manuscript in the unexplored depths of a cave system, a chest of drawers perched in the uppermost boughs of a tree. Legend has it that the itwhisks are taking these objects to places they would rather be. Legend also has it that if you trap one, it must give you your pick of everything it's ever taken. This author has his doubts about the latter.
