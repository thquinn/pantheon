While **Vandine, God of Law** is ostensibly a force for justice in the world, there's an unavoidable measure of self-delusion that comes with the territory. Vandine would love nothing more than to end the machinations of men and the gods, placing everything above board in the service of universal benefit... yet he isn't exactly an open book himself. On occasions where he himself has passed judgment on mortals who committed divine grievances, his moral logic has sometimes befuddled civilians and theologians alike, not strictly adhering to what the public might consider fair. With law as his quiddity, though, his verdicts cannot be overturned. The attempt to reconcile these two disparate ideas — granting power over the many to the few, in the pursuit of equality — is known to theologians and jurists as *Vandine's paradox*.

Nearly all gods have some disdain towards Vandine. He can be seen as a bit of a hypocrite, even setting aside the aforementioned paradox: his attempts to undermine the secret plots of other gods constitute, in essence, a plot of his own. A few gods are able to view this meddling in context — his intentions truly do seem pure — but the concerns of many of the gods, even the good ones, are dominated by self-interest. Vandinians are seen in a similar light by their peers: admired by some, privately mocked by others. Most stereotypically they are guards, soldiers, judges, lawyers, politicians, public servants, and sometimes theologians.

# Pawns

Vandine's foremost pawns are the **justices**, straight-backed creatures hidden beneath layers and layers of grey cloaks and veils. Many gods chose to create mute pawns, but these are decidedly not: whenever a significant judicial or legislative council is convened, they will find themselves confronted with a justice asking to join, and unless they wish to insult the God of Law, they will acquiesce. Throughout the deliberation, it will advocate in somber tones for Vandine's particular notions of law and, if prompted, engage in calm debate. They are, however, not impossible to anger; there are tales of justices met with opposition that causes them to erupt into fits of pious fury, stopping shy of cold-blooded murder but causing quite a commotion nevertheless.

Then there are the **rubicons**, the instruments of Vandine and his justices. Every law needs enforcement... but if this is the rubicons' purpose, it's not clear that they're the right pawns for the job. They are shapeshifters, taking the form of various inanimate objects to carry out convictions and punishments — balls-and-chains, pillories, and even guillotines — and they possess incredible strength, but only against those deemed guilty of the specific offense for which they were deployed. In less upstanding parts of the world, their presence is not often appreciated, and they must either work together with justices to maintain Vandine's order or risk being utterly destroyed by malcontents.
