**Emdre, Goddess of Manipulation** is playing a game that no other being can fully appreciate. It spans all of existence, it operates by byzantine, yet flexible rules, and it is strictly zero sum. Every move Emdre makes has purpose: that of her own self-exaltation, or of the disruption of those who oppose her. She possesses supreme intelligence, but lacks the ability to comprehend mutual benefit in any timeframe exceeding the short term. While this can strain her relationship with the other gods, most recognize the advantages in working with her; in all cases, she has anticipated their desires and developed layers of contingency that exceed even divine standards.

While this facet of her personality eclipses the nuances of her many quiddities, those born under her are able to express them more directly. Emdrites aren't all ruthless schemers; they are craftspeople, artists and entertainers, hunters, and scholars, along with the stereotypical thieves and corrupt politicians. They look to their goddess for guidance, in hopes that they may further one of her many plots and perhaps extract some benefit of their own along the way. To Emdre and her children, this reciprocal manipulation is a poignant celebration of the world as it really is.

# Pawns

Emdre's most prevalent pawns, the **syrchions**, have a menacingly feminine form. A little smaller than the average woman, the syrchion is a mass of taut metallic cables, bundled and segmented to give the suggestion of anthropomorph&shy;ism. Their state of constant tension is evident; as they move, these cables scrape and snap against each other in a way that is, somehow, not entirely unpleasant to the ear. They are monstrously strong, an overt quality that seems antithetical to Emdre's usual manner of operation, and when sufficiently provoked, can partially unravel their bodies to form countless thrashing, flaying whips.

This isn't really known to happen, though, and syrchions can be found among common people, especially performing duties where their strength is an asset: construction, hauling, and protection. To convince them to execute such tasks, one need only make an offering to their goddess. One also may find that the price of their service is not an iota less than one can afford.
