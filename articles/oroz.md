About **Oroz, Goddess of Paths** herself, you know very little.

# Pawns

Of Oroz's pawns, humans certainly get the most use out of the **parrals**. They are sleek quadrupedal steeds, smaller in stature than a typical riding horse, with outwardly *cactaceous* qualities. Not that they look exactly like four-legged succulents, but their bulbous forelimbs and green ridges that run across their bodies bring the plant kingdom to mind... and then, of course, there are the thorns. There are many reasons that they have not completely supplanted horses. Parrals are:

* more fragile than a well-bred horse,
* less able to carry heavy loads and perform farm labor,
* slower over long distances and during the night,
* more prone to spooking,
* more willful,
* and that's not to mention the thorns.

Some experienced riders do prefer them, however, as they:

* are more intelligent than horses, understanding a not-insignificant percentage of spoken language,
* possess a supernatural ability to sense danger,
* are faster and nimbler over short distances and during the day,
* require less food and water, reportedly supplementing the former with photosynthesis,
* can be regrown (with great difficulty) from their component parts, and
* can use their aforementioned thorns defensively, making them unattractive targets.

It's widely claimed that Oroz also created the horse, and that parrals were her second attempt at an animal to further man's pursuit of her virtues. This theory is disputed both by theologians, and by veterinarians who have cared for parrals wounded during everday riding. As notable panspecies doctor Serkan Das is known to have said during a moment of frustration: "there's no way she could have done even worse the second time."
