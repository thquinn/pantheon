The island village of **Nuray** is a curious place. Located on the inner coast of the largest of the Eyelet Isles, its culture is dominated by the tradition of *pursuance*, which dictates that when children become adults, they must go out and make their mark upon the world. As a direct result, Nuray has a plurality population of people aged 0 through 19, no one between 20 and 23, and a slow transition to a normal curve from there. The typical family has between five and seven children, a (mostly) subconscious measure against the eventual loss of most of them. Not that they're all *lost* lost — having traveled far and wide, it isn't uncommon for a Nuraean to choose somewhere else to settle down — but the risk entailed by sending inexperienced young people out on their own is substantial, and some do indeed die.

With relatively few adults and so many hungry mouths to feed, Nuraean kids are put to work from an early age: fishing, foraging in the island jungles, basket weaving, water carrying. Even with abundant child labor, there's never quite enough food to go around; custom prescribes that Nuray's elders bear the brunt of the hunger, so the young can grow strong and find their destiny.
