**Vicunius, God of Apathy**... truthfully, there isn't much to say about the god himself. If there are circumstances that spur him to action, history has no record of them. It's possible that it has never once happened, for he is not credited for the creation of anything at all, nor any particularly impressive achievements. He *is*, however, noteworthy for one thing: the frequency with which he visits those born under him. Popular opinion has it, in fact, that more Vicunes have personally met him than not.

With any other god, an audience would be considered an almost unthinkable honor, a landmark event that changes the course of one's life... maybe even history. Vicunius, on the other hand, will usually show up as an uninvited dinner guest, or drop in at an inopportune time just to have a chat. Taking the form of a young man with tousled hair, he's happy to answer questions about divine goings-on, provided the answers don't require too much explanation, and will ask his bounden host questions that indicate a more genuine interest than his quiddity might suggest.

The end result is that Vicunes have a reputation for being effortlessly cool, emphasis on "effortless." After all, is there anything cooler than to have met a god, and to not really care? They are easy conversationalists, trusted confidantes, and calm heads in times of turmoil. There are, of course, negative connotations with being born under the God of Apathy; most people would think twice about hiring one as a babysitter. And hey, they don't mind if you feel that way.
