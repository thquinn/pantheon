"Born in flight, ne'er to alight": so goes the *aition* of **Tiveal, Goddess of Flight**. Is it goes, she has supposedly never touched the ground, and the claim has merit: recorded sightings of her typically mention an immense blur across the sky that quickly vanishes, leaving something changed in its wake. More rarely, dedicated adherents have been whisked away for revelatory journeys through the sky. Tiveal is known for being rather unsubtle when measured against other gods, intervening more directly where others might influence their children to act, or simply send pawns to do their dirty work.

And really, her work could hardly be called "dirty." As far as theologians can tell, much of her time is spent personally orchestrating the migrations of various birds. She has a well understood (but nevertheless unpredictable) habit of fixating for a season on a particular species of rare bird and fiercely protecting its individuals and habitats. Those who depend on hunting to survive eagerly seek out fresh news of Tiveal's earthly actions in hopes of avoiding her ire.

Inventors are another category of folks always trying to stay on her good side. Tiveal is characteristically a jealous warden of the skies, and many flying machines and gadgets that have been shown to work on paper have inexplicably and catastrophically failed during flight tests. Famed polymath Ahmceh Vermalle one published a treatise on a new propulsion method he claimed would revolutionize long-distance travel, and was met by a deluge of correspondence from concerned Tivics warning him that, though his calculations were flawless, the configuration of whirling blades central to his design posed too great a risk to wildlife. Sure enough, his invention ripped itself apart on the test field before it could even get airborne. Savvy tinkerers have learned that the smaller the frame — and the more avian its form — the better its chances.

# Pawns

**Sharplings** are Tiveal's notoriously troublesome pawns. A single sharpling isn't much on its own — a flat triangle, averaging an inch to a side, made of a wickedly sharp and brittle substance — but in apparent imitation of the birds, they tend to travel in flocks. Most veteran travelers have a story to tell about an encounter with them: a sudden gust of wind driving a razor-edged swarm across the path, arms flung in front of the face and cut to ribbons, horses dead and wagon wheels obliterated. And there are even worse stories, of sharplings aligning end to end, connecting to form knife-winged, needle-beaked monstrosities... but surely, those people earned what they got. It doesn't take much to stay on the goddess's good side. Usually.
