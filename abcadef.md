According to popular belief (and common sense), **Abcadef, God of Language** came into being alongside humanity and the needs of the new species. As a god of human abstraction, they represent both language and the myriad ends which it serves in society. Those born under Abcadef stereotypically grow up to be novelists, journalists, philosophers, linguists, and translators.

It's not clear how there came to be quite so many languages: did they arise naturally or was it the god's will? No matter the cause, the result is that Abcadef is sometimes thought of as a being cut off from itself, a god without unified purpose that perhaps doesn't always have humanity's best interests at heart.

Abcadef's influence is often taken for granted; though most all people use language every day, few would think to give thanks to them for their continued ability to speak. Despite this, they have not been known to strike people mute out of spite, or take much punitive action at all, against either their own children or those of their divine rivals, perhaps born from a hestitation to impede open discourse. The God of Language's known interactions with humanity are indirect, advisory at most. When they *have* appeared to mortals, historians have reported their form to be that of a whirlwind of parchment, a mass of shifting lines and motes, or a single, reified word.

# Pawns

Abcadef's most common worldly servants are the **listeners**: tall, slender bipeds with pale and textured skin reminiscent of papier-mâché. Their elongated heads are almost featureless: no eyes or mouth, just the barest suggestion of ears and a nose. They can be seen walking from town to town, and sometimes being blown through the air for miles by the wind, to arrive in a new locale and edge into any public conversations taking place. Human reactions to them differ, with many simply choosing to ignore them, others chasing them away, and Abecedarians usually inviting them into the discussion... though they never seem to have anything to add. A listener is certain to be found in the audience of any speech given. Their utility to their god is unknown; with language as Abcadef's quiddity, one might expect them to hear anything spoken whether one of their pawns is present or not.
