"Born in flight, ne'er to alight": so goes the *aition* of **Tiveal, Goddess of Flight**. The claim that she supposedly has never touched the ground has merit; recorded sightings typically mention a massive blur in the air that quickly vanishes, leaving something changed in its wake. More rarely, dedicated adherents have been whisked away for revelatory journeys through the sky. Tiveal is known for being rather unsubtle when measured against other gods, intervening more directly where others might influence their children to act, or simply send pawns to do their dirty work.

And really, her work could hardly be called "dirty." As far as theologians can tell, much of her time is spent personally orchestrating the migrations of various birds. She has a well understood (but nevertheless unpredictable) habit of fixating for a season on a particular species of rare bird and fiercely protecting its individuals and habitats. Those who depend on hunting to survive eagerly seek out fresh news of Tiveal's earthly actions in hopes of avoiding her ire.

Inventors are another category of folks always trying to stay on her good side. Tiveal is characteristically a jealous warden of the skies, and many flying machines and gadgets that have been shown to work on paper have inexplicably and catastrophically failed during flight tests. Famed polymath Ahmceh Vermalle one published a treatise on a new propulsion method he claimed would revolutionize long-distance travel, and was met by a deluge of correspondence from concerned Tivics warning him that, though his calculations were flawless, the configuration of whirling blades central to his design posed too great a risk to wildlife. Sure enough, his invention ripped itself apart on the test field before it could even get airborne. Savvy tinkerers have learned that the smaller the frame — and the more avian its form — the better its chances of success.
